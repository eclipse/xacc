# Eclipse XACC 
## Hardware Agnostic Quantum Programming 

XACC is a programming framework for extreme-scale, post-exascale accelerator architectures that integrates alongside existing conventional applications. It is a pluggable framework for programming languages and hardware developed for next-gen computing hardware architectures like quantum and neuromorphic computing. It lets computational scientists efficiently offload work to attached accelerators through user-friendly Kernel definitions. XACC makes post-exascale hybrid programming approachable for domain computational scientists.

XACC currently supports hybrid classical-quantum programming and enables the execution of quantum kernels on IBM, Rigetti, and D-Wave QPUs.
