# XACC - e **_X_** treme-scale **_ACC_** elerator programming framework

XACC is a programming framework for extreme-scale, post-exascale accelerator architectures that integrates alongside existing conventional applications. It is a pluggable framework for programming languages and hardware developed for next-gen computing hardware architectures like quantum and neuromorphic computing. It lets computational scientists efficiently offload work to attached accelerators through user-friendly Kernel definitions. XACC makes post-exascale hybrid programming approachable for domain computational scientists.
