## Language and Hardware Independent Quantum Programming Framework
XACC is an extensible compilation framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing architectures.
It provides extensible language frontend and hardware backend compilation components glued together
via a novel quantum intermediate representation. XACC currently supports quantum-classical programming
and enables the execution of quantum kernels on IBM, Rigetti, and D-Wave QPUs, as well as a number
of quantum computer simulators.

Documentation

Build from Source
-----------------
Ensure that you have installed CMake 3.12+, a C++14 compliant compiler (GCC 6+, Clang 3.4+), and
CURL development headers and libraries with OpenSSL support
(see [prerequisites](http://xacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#pre-requisites)).

Optional dependencies include BLAS and LAPACK development libraries (for various simulators),
Python 3 development headers (for the Python API), and Libunwind (for stack trace printing).

To enable Python support, ensure that `python3` is set to your desired version of Python 3. CMake will
find the corresponding development headers. Ensure that when you try to run XACC-enabled Python scripts
you are using the same `python3` executable that was set during your build.

If you are on Mac OS X, make sure you have XCode command utilities installed. A common issue seen
is missing standard includes like `wchar.h` and others. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52530212)
for proper XCode install and configuring to address these types of issues.

Clone the repository recursively, configure with `cmake` and build with `make`
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse/xacc
$ cd xacc && mkdir build && cd build
[default cmake call]
$ cmake ..
[with tests and examples]
$ cmake .. -DXACC_BUILD_EXAMPLES=TRUE -DXACC_BUILD_TESTS=TRUE
[now build xacc]
$ make install
[for a speedier build on linux]
$ make -j$(nproc --all) install
[and on mac os x]
$ make -j$(sysctl -n hw.physicalcpu) install
[if built with tests, run them]
$ ctest --output-on-failure
```
See full documentation for all CMake optional arguments. To enable MLPack Optimizer support, see
[MLPack Readme](https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/xacc/optimizer/README.md)

Your installation will be in `$HOME/.xacc`. If you built with the Python API,
be sure to update your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to point to the installation:
```bash
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/.xacc
```

You will probably want the XACC default simulator, TNQVM. To install, run the following:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ornl-qci/tnqvm
$ cd tnqvm && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=~/.xacc
$ make install
```
