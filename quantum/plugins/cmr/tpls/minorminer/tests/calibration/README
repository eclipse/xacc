NOTE:

The files in this directory are autogenerated to provide a suite
of rapid smoketests.  Each file contains a pair of numbers,
resectively the number of successes counted during a calibration
run, and the number of trials that comprise the calibration run.

During testing, a test will be run until a success is found, or
until the run of failures is deemed unreasonably improbable
according to the calibration.
