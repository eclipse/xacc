Plugins
=======

XACC provides a number of framework extension points that enable users to program
available quantum accelerators in a plug-and-play manner. This is accomplished
through the C++ native Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) implementation provided
by the `CppMicroServices <https://github.com/cppmicroservices/cppmicroservices>`_
framework.

Developers can extend the following interfaces in the core framework:
`Compiler <https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/xacc/compiler/Compiler.hpp>`_,
`Preprocessor <https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/xacc/compiler/Preprocessor.hpp>`_,
`Accelerator <https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/xacc/accelerator/Accelerator.hpp>`_,
`IRTransformation <https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/xacc/ir/IRTransformation.hpp>`_,
`IRPreprocessor <https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/xacc/ir/IRPreprocessor.hpp>`_,
`IRGenerator <https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/xacc/ir/IRGenerator.hpp>`_, and
`EmbeddingAlgorithm <https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/quantum/aqc/compiler/EmbeddingAlgorithm.hpp>`_ .

Plugins can be stand-alone, sand-boxed projects that provide an appropriate
implementation of an XACC extensible interface. Plugins should be compiled and built
as shared libraries, and those shared libraries can be dropped into the
``$XACC_INSTALL/plugins`` directory and immediately leveraged by the framework.

Below we detail the plugins that are currently available for use with XACC. These plugins
enable the programming, compilation, and execution of quantum algorithms for Rigetti,
D-Wave, and IBM QPUs, as well as a number of backend simulators. They additionally
provide a mechanism to write XACC quantum kernels using Quil, OpenQasm, XACC IR, and D-Wave
QMI low-level languages.

Rigetti
-------
Installation
++++++++++++

The `Rigetti Plugin <https://github.com/ornl-qci/xacc-rigetti>`_ provides
support to XACC for compiling kernels written in Quil, and executing programs
on the Rigetti Forest infrastructure.

To install this plugin from source, run the following

.. code::

   $ git clone https://github.com/ornl-qci/xacc-rigetti
   $ cd xacc-rigetti && mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$HOME/.xacc # or wherever XACC is installed
   $ make install

If you installed the XACC Python bindings, then you can run

.. code::

   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$(python -m xacc -L)

ensuring that xacc is in your ``PYTHONPATH``.

If you installed XACC via ``pip``, then you can run

.. code::

   $ python -m pip install xacc-rigetti (with --user if you used that flag for your xacc install)


Credentials
+++++++++++

In order to target the Rigetti Forest infrastructure you must provide XACC with your API key. By default
XACC will use your PyQuil Config file at ``$HOME/.pyquil_config``.
See `Connecting to the Rigetti Forest <https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/start.html#connecting-to-rigetti-forest>`_ for information on creating this file.

If you do not have a ``$HOME/.pyquil_config`` file, and you have installed the XACC Python bindings, then you can run

.. code::

   $ python -m xacc -c rigetti -k YOURAPIKEY -u YOURUSERID

Rigetti Runtime Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++
The Rigetti plugin exposes the following runtime options

+------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Argument               |            Description                 |
+========================+========================================+
| rigetti-backend        | The backend to target (defaults to QVM)|
+------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| rigetti-trials         | The number of shots to execute per job |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------+

IBM
---

Installation
++++++++++++

The `IBM Plugin <https://github.com/ornl-qci/xacc-ibm>`_ provides
support to XACC for compiling kernels written in OpenQasm, and executing programs
on both the IBM Quantum Experience and the IBM Q Network.

To install this plugin from source, run the following

.. code::

   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ornl-qci/xacc-ibm
   $ cd xacc-ibm && mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$HOME/.xacc # or wherever XACC is installed
   $ make install

If you installed the XACC Python bindings, then replace the above CMake command with

.. code::

   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$(python -m xacc -L)

ensuring that xacc is in your ``PYTHONPATH``.

If you installed XACC via ``pip``, then you can run

.. code::

   $ python -m pip install xacc-ibm (with --user if you used that flag for your xacc install)

.. note::

      The xacc-ibm project also provides an Accelerator implementation that
      delegates to a local build of the Qiskit C++ qasm simulator.
      This Accelerator implementation requires BLAS/LAPACK libraries to be installed.
      Here's how to install these as binaries on various popular platforms:

      .. code::

         $ (macosx) should already be there in Accelerate Framework, if not
         $ (macosx) brew install openblas lapack
         $ (fedora) dnf install blas-devel lapack-devel
         $ (ubuntu) apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev

Credentials
+++++++++++

In order to target the IBM Quantum Experience or Q Network infrastructure you must provide XACC with your API key.

If you installed the XACC Python bindings, then you can run

.. code::

   $ python -m xacc -c ibm -k YOURAPIKEY (--hub HUB --group GROUP --project PROJECT)


Alternatively, open the file ``$HOME/.ibm_config``, and add the following contents

.. code:: bash

   key: YOUR_API_KEY
   url: https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net
   hub: HUB
   group: GROUP
   project: PROJECT

Note the ``hub``, ``group``, and ``project`` lines are not required if you are targeting the public
Quantum Experience API.

IBM Runtime Options
+++++++++++++++++++
The IBM plugin exposes the following runtime options

+------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Argument               |            Description                 |
+========================+========================================+
| ibm-backend            | The backend to target (e.g. ibmqx5)    |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| ibm-shots              | The number of shots to execute per job |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------+

TNQVM
-----

Installation
++++++++++++

The `TNQVM Plugin <https://github.com/ornl-qci/tnqvm>`_ provides
support to XACC for executing programs
on the ORNL tensor network quantum virtual machine. TNQVM models the wave
function of a quantum register as a tensor network, and specifically a matrix
product state. For more information on the TNQVM simulation method, check out
`Validating Quantum-Classical Programming Models with Tensor Network Simulations <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07914>`_


.. note::

   TNQVM requires BLAS/LAPACK libraries to be installed.
   Here's how to install these as binaries on various popular platforms:

   .. code::

      $ (macosx) should already be there in Accelerate Framework, if not
      $ (macosx) brew install openblas lapack
      $ (fedora) dnf install blas-devel lapack-devel
      $ (ubuntu) apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev

To install this plugin, run the following

.. code::

   $ git clone https://github.com/ornl-qci/tnqvm
   $ cd tnqvm && mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$HOME/.xacc
   $ make install

If you installed the XACC Python bindings, then you can run

.. code::

   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$(python -m xacc -L)

ensuring that xacc is in your ``PYTHONPATH``.

If you installed XACC via ``pip``, then you can run

.. code::

   $ python -m pip install tnqvm (with --user if you used that flag for your xacc install)

D-Wave
------

Installation
++++++++++++

The `D-Wave Plugin <https://github.com/ornl-qci/xacc-dwave>`_ provides
support to XACC for executing programs on the D-Wave QPU via the D-Wave Accelerator.

To install this plugin, run the following

.. code::

   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ornl-qci/xacc-dwave
   $ cd xacc-dwave && mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$HOME/.xacc
   # make install

Alternatively, if you installed the XACC Python bindings, then you can run

.. code::

   $ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$(python -m xacc -L)

ensuring that the ``xacc`` module is in your ``PYTHONPATH``.

Credentials
+++++++++++

In order to target the D-Wave remote resources you must provide
XACC with your D-Wave Qubist API key. By default
XACC will search for a config file at ``$HOME/.dwave_config``.

If you installed the XACC Python bindings, then you can run

.. code::

   $ python -m xacc -c dwave -k YOURAPIKEY
